# spat

A work-in-progress Spotify API client.  spat (Spotify Playlist Authoring Tool) has a rudimentary UI, Spotify HTTP
client support, and custom non-SQL persistence using Apache Fury and LMDB.  There are plans to add more features:
the actual "authoring" functionality, web scraping to build a comprehensive database, custom exports, a CLI,
and maybe more.
